# IDS6145(SimTech 2018) - Research Plan

> * Group Name: The Quarter Dirty Dozen
> * Group participants names: Brian Varns, Gabrielle Vasquez, Matthias Weber
> * Project Title: Traffic-planning-support

**1. What is the topic?**

Our topic is dealing with the issue of city-planning in general and in special measures that can decrease the traffic in certain areas (e.g. by adding new roads).
 
**2. What do you want do?**

We want to start modeling a simple highway with multiple on- and off-ramps.
After the system is producing the corresponding traffic data (including hotspots), we want to add an additional road to bypass the highway and analyze, if this could reduce the overall traffic.
 
**3. Why is it important?**

Traffic is a current problem in large cities and we want to figure out, if additional roads could help to minimize traffic jams or if the city-planners have to find some other measurements to face this situation.
